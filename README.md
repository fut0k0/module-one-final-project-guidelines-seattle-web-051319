# Lyrics Builder

This CLI application allows the user to build their own set of lyrics. The user is able to search for and collect lyrics for different songs. Using the collection of song lyrics, individual lines of lyrics can be stored and saved as a collection (snippets). Both the song / lyric collection and snippets may be saved and managed on a per user basis.

Lyrics Builder uses the lyrics.ovh API.
